# Blank Theme - Jekyll
An almost empty "starter theme" for Jekyll projects.

Most themes I see say "starter theme", but they're filled with stupid SASS grids and shit. I made this as the lowest common denominator for almost all developers. 

It's set up for SASS, meta tags, favicons, a home page, etc. Everything else is up to you.

Now start building some dope-ass shit, playboy.
